// async-> asynchrous code
// js is a synchronous language.
// it is a single threaded langauage// these both are default js behaviour
/*
execution context: execute one line of code at a time
jb tk purana stament execute ni hga tb tk naya ni hga

 */

/*
block code vs non blocking code
1)block code blocks the flow of program
2) it reads file sync which means jb tk file read hri h tb tk koi aur kaam ni hga


1)non blocking code does nt block executiom
2)it reads file async jb tk file read hri h tb tk aur kaam bhi ho skta h
